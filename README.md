The Last Player Picked Price Guide is a PHP tool originally at http://www.lastplayerpicked.com/priceguide/.

The Price Guide generates fantasy baseball dollar values customized for a myriad of league configurations. Dollar values can be customized for the number of teams, number of starters at each position, stat categories used, etc.

A few disclaimers about the source:

First, writing this program was a one-man show, and so there are a few places where a little manual intervention is required. Comments in the code are pretty light, but I tried to make the code itself as self-explanatory as possible. Also, as a hobby project, I  didn't attempt any version control (until now), meaning that previous revisions are lost forever.

Second, writing this program was how I learned PHP. If you already know PHP, you can probably tell.

Third, this program was expanded over the last six years. Usually, I didn't bother to go back to make previous years' data work with the new features. (For example, I experimented with composite projections for a couple of seasons before I found a system that worked best, but you can still see traces of those earlier composites in the code.)
